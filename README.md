# logstash-output-cloudwatchlogs
A logstash plugin that allows to send logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs service.

## Developing

### 1. Plugin Developement and Testing

#### Code
- To get started, you'll need JRuby with the Bundler gem installed.

- Clone the repository.

- Install dependencies
```sh
bundle install
```

#### Test

- Update your dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

- Run tests

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

### 2. Running your unpublished Plugin in Logstash

#### 2.1 Run in a local Logstash clone

- Edit Logstash `Gemfile` and add the local plugin path, for example:
```ruby
gem "logstash-output-cloudwatchlogs", :path => "/your/local/logstash-output-cloudwatchlogs"
```
- Install plugin
```sh
bin/plugin install --no-verify
```
- Run Logstash with your plugin

At this point any modifications to the plugin code will be applied to this local Logstash setup. After modifying the plugin, simply rerun Logstash.

#### 2.2 Run in an installed Logstash

You can use the same **2.1** method to run your plugin in an installed Logstash by editing its `Gemfile` and pointing the `:path` to your local plugin development directory or you can build the gem and install it using:

- Build your plugin gem
```sh
gem build logstash-output-cloudwatchlogs.gemspec
```
- Install the plugin from the Logstash home
```sh
bin/plugin install /your/local/plugin/logstash-output-cloudwatchlogs.gem
```
- Start Logstash and proceed to test the plugin

## Usage

Below sample configuration reads 2 log4j logs and sends them to 2 log streams respectively.

```
input {
  file {
    path => "/path/to/app1.log"
    start_position => beginning
    tags => ["app1"]
  }
  file {
    path => "/path/to/app2.log"
    start_position => beginning
    tags => ["app2"]
  }
}

filter {
  multiline {
    pattern => "^%{MONTHDAY} %{MONTH} %{YEAR} %{TIME}"
    negate => true
    what => "previous"
  }
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "(?<timestamp>%{MONTHDAY} %{MONTH} %{YEAR} %{TIME})" }
  }
  date {
    match => [ "timestamp", "dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss,SSS" ]
    target => "@timestamp"
  }
}

output {
  if "app1" in [tags] {
    cloudwatchlogs {
      "log_group_name" => "app1"
      "log_stream_name" => "host1"
    }
  }
  if "app2" in [tags] {
    cloudwatchlogs {
      "log_group_name" => "app2"
      "log_stream_name" => "host1"
    }
  }
}

```

Here are all the supported options:

* region: string, the AWS region, defaults to us-east-1.
* access_key_id: string, specifies the access key.
* secret_access_key: string, specifies the secret access key.
* aws_credentials_file: string, points to a file which specifies access_key_id and secret_access_key.
* log_group_name: string, required, specifies the destination log group. A log group will be created automatically if it doesn't already exist.
* log_stream_name: string, required, specifies the destination log stream. A log stream will be created automatically if it doesn't already exist.
* batch_count: number, the max number of log events in a batch, up to 10000.
* batch_size: number, the max size of log events in a batch, in bytes, up to 1048576.
* buffer_duration: number, the amount of time to batch log events, in milliseconds, from 5000 milliseconds.
* queue_size: number, the max number of batches to buffer, defaults to 5.
* dry_run: boolean, prints out the log events to stdout instead of sending them to CloudWatch Logs service.

Extra options:

* use_codec: boolean, allows you to to enable a custom codec to be used for event formatting (default: false)
* codec: string, the type of codec that you want to use (ex: "json")


In addition to configuring the AWS credential in the configuration file, credentials can also be loaded automatically from the following locations:

* ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] and ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
* The shared credentials ini file at ~/.aws/credentials (more information)
* From an instance profile when running on EC2

```
cloudwatchlogs {
  "log_group_name" => "lg2"
  "log_stream_name" => "ls1"
  "batch_count" => 1000
  "batch_size" => 1048576
  "buffer_duration" => 5000
  "queue_size" => 10
  "dry_run" => false
}
```
